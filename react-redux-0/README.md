# Learnings from the project

# Understanding Redux:
 You will gain a deeper understanding of Redux and its purpose in managing the state of JavaScript applications. Redux provides a centralized store for state management, making it easier to manage complex application states.

# Setting up Redux: 
You will learn how to set up Redux in a JavaScript application by initializing a Redux store with an initial state and a reducer function. This involves understanding the createStore function and how to define reducers.

# Defining Actions:
 You will understand the concept of actions in Redux and how to define action types and action creators. Actions represent the events that occur in the application, and they are dispatched to the store to trigger state updates.

# Implementing Reducers:
 You will learn how to implement reducer functions to handle each action type and update the state accordingly. Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

# Dispatching Actions:
 You will gain experience in dispatching actions to the Redux store from components to trigger state updates. Dispatching actions is a crucial part of the Redux workflow and allows components to interact with the store.

# Accessing State: 
You will learn how to access state data from the Redux store in React components using the useSelector hook. This allows components to access the current state and render it in the user interface.

# Displaying Data:
 You will understand how to display data from the Redux store in the application's user interface. This involves rendering state data in components and updating the UI in response to state changes.
